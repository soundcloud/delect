# Delect - The Gradle Plugin for Dagger Reflect

Delect automatically substitutes Dagger for Dagger Reflect for development builds.

[Dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger), a dependency injection framework for Java, can slow down compilation with its lengthy annotation processing and code generation.

[Dagger Reflect](https://github.com/jakewharton/dagger-reflect) uses the same API as Dagger but swaps the compile time annotation processing for runtime based reflection.

## Usage
1. Add the plugin to your project's root build.gradle:
```
buildscript {
  classpath 'com.soundcloud.delect:delect-plugin:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT'
}
apply plugin: 'com.soundcloud.delect'
```
2. Add the runtime retention policy to all `@Qualifier` annotations:
```
@Retention(RUNTIME)
```
3. Add `dagger.reflect=true` to `gradle.properties`.
  You can also add it to `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` so it doesn't need to be checked int o the project.
4. Build -- and skip all that pesky code generation!
